# DxGui

This is a DirectX GUI Framework in C++ I created for my senior project in 2002.

It was heavily-influenced by my previous experience with Windows development. I would do it very differently if I were to write this now. It's quite interesting to look back on what I did that long ago, particularly how I implemented many data structures myself. However, the STL was not yet finalized, so I supposed that played a big factor.

Anyways, you're welcome to check it out and play around with it. Last time I ran the executable on my Windows machine, it still worked.
